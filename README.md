## Using SAL-TE

SAL-TE starts in `command mode` with a prompt on the last but one line of the terminal. Here, we enter the line number of the line we want to edit.

Want to go-to a particular line? 

    Use Control-G
    Type line number

Scroll up or down lines?

    Use the arrow keys of course!

Started editing a line? This you could do
    
    Move the cursor around with the arrow keys.
    Add/edit/remove characters from the line.
    If the line won't fit in the terminal, you can scroll up and down (with the arrow keys, of course).

Done editing? Save and quit with

    Control-Q

Want to discard changes? No problem!

    Control-X

There will be no warnings though! Use with caution!
